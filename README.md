# FoN
Web App Practicum for non-profit Friends of Noise. Our group project was to create a member's portal. I worked on the member's portal homepage and the payment page. The member's portal homepage pulled data from a phpmyadmin database to show the member's name, member ID, and status upon log in. The payment page was to buy memberships or make donations.
